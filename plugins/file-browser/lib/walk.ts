/**
 * Recursive listing of a directory that lives on the machine running this
 * plugin. BB's own `files.listPaths` silently drops every dotfile, so a
 * workspace listed through it has no `.github`, `.env`, or `.gitignore` — this
 * walk exists so a local workspace really does show all of its files.
 *
 * Breadth-first by directory: when a workspace is larger than `limit`, what
 * survives is the shallow part of the tree rather than an arbitrary deep
 * branch.
 *
 * Symlinks are skipped rather than followed, which is both what BB does and
 * what keeps a cyclic link from hanging the walk.
 *
 * Throws if the ROOT cannot be read — a workspace that was deleted underneath
 * BB must not be reported as an empty one. Directories that fail mid-walk are
 * skipped, since the rest of the tree is still worth returning.
